I am a software engineer with experience leading teams and managing product. I convert decent coffee into quality code. I am passionate about building highly cohesive and effective Agile teams. I currently work at <a href="http://ocadotechnology.com">Ocado Technology</a>. I speak at conferences on occasion.

This blog is about things that interest me, including programming, leadership and theoretical computer science.
